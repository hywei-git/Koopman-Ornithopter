To Simulate
1. PID, run ****
2. Linear MPC, run ****
3. Nonlinear MPC, run ****
4. MPC in original space, run ****
   - This may take around 2 hr to run

Data training procedure
1. To get training data, run ****
   - This may take around 1 hr with parallel computing ****
3. To train linear Koopman operator, run ****

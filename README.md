This repo contains all source files to replicate the results presented

To Simulate
1. PID, run ****
2. Linear MPC, run ****
   - In line ****, toggle online regression and integral controller on/off as desired
4. Nonlinear MPC, run ****
5. MPC in original space, run ****
   - This may take around 2 hr to run

Data training procedure
1. To get training data, run ****
   - This may take around 1 hr with parallel computing ****
3. To train linear Koopman operator, run ****
4. To train nonlinear Koopman operator, run ****

To plot all results, run ****
